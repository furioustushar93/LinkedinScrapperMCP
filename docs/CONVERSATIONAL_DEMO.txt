────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You: What are the requirements?

💬 Gemini: For the Python Backend Engineer at Meta, the requirements include:
• 5+ years of Python development experience
• Strong knowledge of distributed systems
• Experience with PostgreSQL, Redis
• Familiarity with microservices architecture

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You: Compare this with job #1

💬 Gemini: Comparing Meta (#2) vs Google (#1):

Google - Senior Python Developer:
  • More senior level (8+ years)
  • Infrastructure focus
  • Higher compensation range

Meta - Python Backend Engineer:
  • Mid-senior level (5+ years)
  • Backend APIs focus
  • Competitive but slightly lower range

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You: Which one should I apply to?

💬 Gemini: It depends on your background:

If you have 8+ years experience and want infrastructure work → Google (#1)
If you have 5-7 years and prefer backend APIs → Meta (#2)

Both are excellent companies. Google might offer slightly higher compensation,
but Meta's role focuses more on backend development which matches your query.

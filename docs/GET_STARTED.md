## 🎯 Next Steps - Get This Running!

### Step 1: Complete Installation (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/tusharaggarwal/Documents/Self-Learning/mcp

# Run the automated installer
bash install.sh

# This will:
# ✅ Create virtual environment
# ✅ Install all dependencies
# ✅ Set up configuration
# ✅ Create log directory
# ✅ Run tests
```

### Step 2: Configure Your Credentials (2 minutes)

```bash
# Copy and edit the environment file
cp .env.example .env
nano .env

# Update these lines:
LINKEDIN_EMAIL=your.actual.email@example.com
LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your_actual_password
```

**Important**: Use your real LinkedIn credentials for the scraper to work!

### Step 3: Test It Out (2 minutes)

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the example
python examples/example_usage.py

# You should see output showing the scraper in action!
```

### Step 4: Integrate with Claude Desktop (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Open Claude Desktop config
nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# 2. Copy the config from:
cat examples/claude_desktop_config.json

# 3. Paste it into Claude's config file
# 4. Make sure to use the ABSOLUTE path to server.py
# 5. Add your LinkedIn credentials

# 6. Restart Claude Desktop
```

### Step 5: Try It in Claude!

Once Claude Desktop restarts, you can ask:

```
"Can you help me scrape a LinkedIn profile?"

"Search for Python developer jobs in San Francisco"

"Get information about Google as a company on LinkedIn"

"Find machine learning engineers in New York"
```

## 🎓 Understanding Your Project

### The 4 Core Tools You Built

1. **`scrape_linkedin_profile`**
   - Extracts profile data from LinkedIn
   - Returns name, headline, experience, etc.
   - Uses both API and web scraping

2. **`search_linkedin_jobs`**
   - Searches for jobs by keywords
   - Filters by location, type, level
   - Returns structured job data

3. **`get_company_info`**
   - Retrieves company details
   - Shows size, industry, location
   - Includes follower metrics

4. **`search_people`**
   - Finds people by keywords
   - Filters by location/company
   - Returns profile summaries

### Key Technologies You're Using

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Connects AI to tools
- **Python 3.10+**: Modern Python with async
- **BeautifulSoup**: HTML parsing for scraping
- **LinkedIn API**: Official API wrapper
- **pytest**: Testing framework

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error
```bash
# Make sure you're in the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Authentication failed"
```bash
# Check your .env file
cat .env

# Make sure email and password are correct
# LinkedIn may require CAPTCHA on first login
```

### Server not showing in Claude
```bash
# Check Claude Desktop config
cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json

# Make sure path is absolute (not relative)
# Example: /Users/tusharaggarwal/Documents/Self-Learning/mcp/src/server.py
```

### Rate limit errors
```bash
# LinkedIn limits requests - this is normal
# Wait a few minutes and try again
# Increase RATE_LIMIT_DELAY in .env if needed
```
